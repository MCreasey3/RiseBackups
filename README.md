Manual save file backups for Steam games


I'm using this PowerShell script to manually back up my save files for Monster Hunter Rise. Playing the game with mods installed can sometimes cause Steam to corrupt and subsequently lose all Cloud saved data. 

Will add instructions for use in the future.
